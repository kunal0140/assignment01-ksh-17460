                Google CEO Eric Schmidt opposed the development of an independent web browser for six years. He stated that "at the time, Google was a small company", and he did not want to go through "bruising browser wars". After co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page hired several Mozilla Firefox developers and built a demonstration of Chrome, Schmidt admitted that "It was so good that it essentially forced me to change my mind."<br><br>
                In September 2004, rumors of Google building a web browser first appeared. Online journals and U.S. newspapers stated at the time that Google was hiring former Microsoft web developers among others. It also came shortly after the final 1.0 release of Mozilla Firefox, which was surging in popularity and taking market share from Internet Explorer, which was suffering from major security problems.<br><br>
                The browser was first publicly released on September 2, 2008 for Windows XP and later, with 43 supported languages, officially a beta version,and as a stable public release on December 11, 2008.

                <span>Google Chrome browser is an open source program for accessing the World Wide Web and running Web-based applications.Chrome was the first major Web browser to combine the search box and the address bar, a feature that most competitors have since adopted. It also allows users to sign in with their Google accounts, which enables them to sync bookmarks and open Web pages across multiple devices. In 2010, Google launched the Chrome Web Store, an online marketplace where users can buy and install Web-based applications to run inside the browser.
